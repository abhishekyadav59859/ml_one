# ml_one

A lightweight project repository named **ml_one** by Abhishek Yadav.  
This repository contains a simple machine-learning (or learning machine) demo implemented in C and Python.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This repository showcases an experimentation environment combining:

- A main component written in **C** (about ~88% of the codebase)  
- A smaller component in **Python** (~11% of the codebase)  
- Work in progress: organized under the branch `main`, with a few commits so far  

At present, the repository includes files:
- `runn.c` ‚Äî the core C source file  
- `work_1` ‚Äî a working directory or module for initial experiments  
- Possibly Python scripts (if applicable)  

The main goal is to explore and learn how machine-learning (or algorithmic modelling) can be structured using C and Python together: from data ingestion, model implementation, to execution and output.

## ‚úÖ Features

- Pure C implementation: high-performance code for core logic  
- Python support: for data manipulation, scripting, or glue-code  
- Simple structure: easy to understand, experiment and extend  
- Suitable for learning, prototyping, and educational purposes

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have:
- A C compiler (e.g., `gcc` or `clang`)  
- Python (e.g., Python 3.x) if you want to run the Python component  
- Basic command-line / terminal knowledge  

### Installation & Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhishekyadav59859/ml_one.git
   cd ml_one
